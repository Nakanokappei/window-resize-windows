# Privacy Policy — Window Resize for Windows

*Last updated: March 1, 2026*

## Overview

Window Resize for Windows ("the App") is a desktop utility that resizes application windows to preset sizes from the system tray. The App is designed with privacy in mind and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

## Data Collection

The App does **not** collect any personal information. Specifically:

- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No crash reports sent to external servers
- No user accounts or sign-in
- No network requests of any kind

The App operates entirely offline and requires no internet connection.

## Local Data Storage

The App stores the following data locally on your device only:

- **Custom preset sizes** — window dimensions you add in Settings
- **Screenshot preferences** — whether screenshot capture is enabled, save folder path, and clipboard option
- **Launch at login preference** — whether the app starts automatically

This data is stored in the Windows Registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` and is never transmitted externally.

## Screenshots

When the screenshot feature is enabled by the user, the App captures an image of the resized window. Screenshots are:

- Saved to a local folder chosen by the user, and/or copied to the clipboard
- Never uploaded, transmitted, or shared by the App

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any data from any user, including children.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the revised version will be published in the App's repository at:
